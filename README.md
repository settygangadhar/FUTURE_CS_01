# 🔐 OWASP Juice Shop – Web Application Security Assessment

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **real-world Web Application Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT)** conducted on **OWASP Juice Shop**, an intentionally vulnerable web application created for security training.

The objective was to identify, exploit, and document common web application vulnerabilities by following **OWASP Top 10** standards and ethical hacking best practices.  
All findings were compiled into a **professional client-style security assessment report**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify security vulnerabilities in a web application
- Perform both **automated and manual testing**
- Map findings to **OWASP Top 10 (2021)**
- Assess risk using a **CVSS-style risk matrix**
- Produce an **enterprise-grade security report (PDF)**
